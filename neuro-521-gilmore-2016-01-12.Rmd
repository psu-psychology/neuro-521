## 2015-01-12 -- Brain architectures for adaptive behavior

1. What behaviors are essential for animals to perform?
2. How is the nervous system organized to contribute to these behaviors?
3. Should molecular neurobiologists think about ethology? Should cognitive neuroscientists think about molecular neurobiology? Why or why not?

## 2015-01-14 -- Divide and conquer: Functional segregation in sensory processing

1. How can functional properties of neurons in the cerebral cortex be studied?
2. What are the properties of sensory-related neurons in the cerebral cortex?
3. Are there similarities across sensory systems?

## 2015-01-19 -- Maps in the cortex

1. What is the evidence for a topographic organization in sensory and motor processing?
2. Are maps fundamental to sensory processing or merely a byproduct of other factors?

## 2015-01-21 -- Studying human brain function through fMRI

1. How does fMRI work? What does it measure?
2. How do "functional" maps of the cerebral cortex derived from fMRI relate to maps derived from other methods?
3. How are fMRI-based maps actually created?
