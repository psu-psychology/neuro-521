	abstract = {The basic plan of nervous system organization has been investigated since classical antiquity. The first model centered on pneumas pumped from sensory nerves through the ventricular system and out motor nerves to muscles. It was popular well into the 17th century and diverted attention from the organization of brain parenchyma itself. Willis focused on gray matter production and white matter conduction of pneumas in 1664, and by the late 19th century a clear cellular model of nervous system organization based on sensory, motor, and association neuron classes transmitting nerve impulses was elaborated by Cajal and his contemporaries. Today, revolutionary advances in experimental pathway tracing methods, molecular genetics, and computer science inspire systems neuroscience. Seven minimal requirements are outlined for knowledge management systems capable of describing, analyzing, and modeling the basic plan of nervous system circuitry in general, and the plan evolved for vertebrates, for mammals, and ultimately for humans in particular. The goal remains a relatively simple, easy to understand model analogous to the one Harvey elaborated in 1628 for blood circulation in the cardiovascular system. As Cajal wrote in 1909, “To extend our understanding of neural function to the most complex human physiological and psychological activities, it is essential that we first generate a clear and accurate view of the structure of the relevant centers, and of the human brain itself, so that the basic plan – the overview – can be grasped in the blink of an eye.”},

	abstract = {Auditory cortical processing of complex meaningful sounds entails the transformation of sensory (tonotopic) representations of incoming acoustic waveforms into higher-level sound representations (e.g., their category). However, the precise neural mechanisms enabling such transformations remain largely unknown. In the present study, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and natural sounds stimulation to examine these two levels of sound representation (and their relation) in the human auditory cortex. In a first experiment, we derive cortical maps of frequency preference (tonotopy) and selectivity (tuning width) by mathematical modeling of fMRI responses to natural sounds. The tuning width maps highlight a region of narrow tuning that follows the main axis of Heschl's gyrus and is flanked by regions of broader tuning. The narrowly tuned portion on Heschl's gyrus contains two mirror-symmetric frequency gradients, presumably defining two distinct primary auditory areas. In addition, our analysis indicates that spectral preference and selectivity (and their topographical organization) extend well beyond the primary regions and also cover higher-order and category-selective auditory regions. In particular, regions with preferential responses to human voice and speech occupy the low-frequency portions of the tonotopic map. We confirm this observation in a second experiment, where we find that speech/voice selective regions exhibit a response bias toward the low frequencies characteristic of human voice and speech, even when responding to simple tones. We propose that this frequency bias reflects the selective amplification of relevant and category-characteristic spectral bands, a useful processing step for transforming a sensory (tonotopic) sound image into higher level neural representations.},

Besides providing for the possibility of unambiguously localizing functional imaging data with respect to the functional architecture of the visual system, it is a powerful tool for the investigation of retinotopic properties of visual areas in the healthy and impaired brain. fMRI retinotopic mapping differs conceptually from a more traditional volume-based, block-type, or event-related analysis, in terms of both the surface-based analysis of the data and the phase-encoded paradigm. Several methodological works related to fMRI retinotopic mapping have been published. However, a detailed description of all the methods involved, discussing the steps from stimulus design to the processing of phase data on the surface, is still missing. We describe here step by step our methodology for the complete processing chain. Besides reusing methods proposed by other researchers in the field, we introduce original ones: improved stimuli for the mapping of polar angle retinotopy, a method of assigning volume-based functional data to the surface, and a way of weighting phase information optimally to account for the SNR obtained locally. To assess the robustness of these methods we present a study performed on three subjects, demonstrating the reproducibility of the delineation of low order visual areas.},

As a result, evolutionary selection for some map features may require other features that may not be adaptive. Yet, an overall adaptiveness of brain maps seems likely. Most notably, topographic representations permit interconnections between appropriate sets of neurons to be made in a highly efficient manner. Topographic maps provide an especially suitable substrate for the common spatiotemporal computations for neural circuits.

The motor cortex appears to contain functional zones, each of which emphasizes an ethologically relevant category of behavior. Some of these complex actions can be evoked by cortical stimulation. Although the findings were initially controversial, interest in the ethological action map has grown. Experiments on primates, mice, and rats have now confirmed and extended the earlier findings with a range of new methods., For nearly 150 years, the motor cortex was described as a map of the body. Yet the body map is overlapping and fractured, suggesting that it is not the only organizing principle. In the past 15 years, a second fundamental organizing principle has been discovered: a map of complex, meaningful movements., Different zones in the motor cortex emphasize different actions from the natural movement repertoire of the animal. These complex actions combine multiple muscles and joints., The ‘action map’ organization has now been demonstrated in primates, prosimians, and rodents with various stimulation, lesion, and neuronal recording methods., The action map was initially controversial due to the use of electrical stimulation. The best argument that the action map is not an artifact of one technique is the growing confirming evidence from other techniques.},
