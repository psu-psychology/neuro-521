## 2015-01-14 -- Divide and conquer: Functional segregation in sensory processing

1. How can functional properties of neurons in the cerebral cortex be studied?
2. What are the properties of sensory-related neurons in the cerebral cortex?
3. Are there similarities across sensory systems?

## Key ideas

- Pathway from retina to [striate cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Gennari)
    - [Retina](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Retina) ->
    - Lateral geniculate nucleus of the [thalamus](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Thalamus) ->
    - Striate cortex ([Area V1](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Area_V1) in the occipital lobe)

## Key ideas

- [Receptive fields](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Receptive_field)

##  Definition

"The receptive field is a portion of sensory space that can elicit neuronal responses when stimulated. The sensory space can be defined in a single dimension (e.g. carbon chain length of an odorant), two dimensions (e.g. skin surface) or multiple dimensions (e.g. space, time and tuning properties of a visual receptive field). The neuronal response can be defined as firing rate (i.e. number of action potentials generated by a neuron) or include also subthreshold activity (i.e. depolarizations and hyperpolarizations in membrane potential that do not generate action potentials)."
    
## Findings

- Units spontaneously active (p. 576), .1-10 spikes/s
- Most respond to light stimulation in restricted region
    - "Excitatory" and "inhibitory zones" (p. 577)
    - Simultaneous stimulation of both zones antagonistic

## Findings

- Regions not concentric
    - "Best" stimulus often "slit-shaped" (Fig 2)
- Regions vary in optimal angular orientation (Fig 3)
- Excitatory and inhibitory regions equally common
- Responsiveness may depend on stimulus intensity

## Findings

- Varying motion speeds and directions elicits differential responses
    - Unidirectional and bidirectional selectivity
- Cells vary in response by eye of origin
    - Ipsilateral, contralateral, binocular
