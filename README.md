# NEURO-521 Spring 2016 Gilmore

This is the repository for Rick Gilmore's section of NEURO-521 Spring 2016. The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/psu-psychology/neuro-521).

Please find below information about the required and supplemental readings along with some questions that will guide our discussions. PDFs of all readings are on the course [ANGEL site](https://cms.psu.edu/section/default.asp?id=201516SPUP%5F%5F%5FRNEURO521%5F001).

I have indicated in **boldface** the reading that should be the focus of your review paper.

## 2015-01-12 -- Brain architectures for adaptive behavior

### Lecture notes

- [RMarkdown](https://github.com/psu-psychology/neuro-521/blob/master/neuro-521-gilmore-2016-01-12.Rmd)

### Questions

1. What behaviors are essential for animals to perform?
2. What questions should we ask about these behaviors?
3. How is the nervous system organized to contribute to these behaviors?
4. Should molecular neurobiologists think about ethology? Should cognitive neuroscientists think about molecular neurobiology? Why or why not?

## 2015-01-14 -- Divide and conquer: Functional segregation in sensory processing

### Questions

1. How can functional properties of neurons in the cerebral cortex be studied?
2. What are the properties of sensory-related neurons in the cerebral cortex?
3. Are there similarities across sensory systems?

## 2015-01-19 -- Maps in the cortex

### Questions

1. What is the evidence for a topographic organization in sensory and motor processing?
2. Are maps fundamental to sensory processing or merely a byproduct of other factors?

## 2015-01-21 -- Studying human brain function through fMRI

### Questions

1. How does fMRI work? What does it measure?
2. How do "functional" maps of the cerebral cortex derived from fMRI relate to maps derived from other methods?
3. How are fMRI-based maps actually created?
